    "In recent years, many US states have decided to legalize the use of marijuana. \n",
    "\n",
    "When these ideas were first proposed, there were many theories about the relationship between crime and the \"War on Drugs\" (the term given to US efforts to arrest drug users and dealers over the past several decades). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we're going to test a few of those theories using drug arrest data from the state of California. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though California has passed a number of laws lessening penalities for marijuana possession over the years, arguably the biggest changes were in  2010, when the state changed the penalty for possessing a small amount of marijuana from a criminal crime to a \"civil\" penality (meaning those found guilty only had to pay a fine, not go to jail), though possessing, selling, or producing larger quantities remained illegal. Then in 2016, the state fully legalized marijuana for recreational use, not only making possession of small amounts legal, but also creating a regulatory system for producing marijuana for sale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Proponents of drug legalization have long argued that the war on drugs contributes to violent crime by creating an opportunity for drug dealers and organized crime to sell and distribute drugs, a business which tends to generate violence when gangs battle over territory. According to this theory, with drug legalization, we should see violent crime decrease after legalization in places where drug arrests had previously been common. \n",
    "\n",
    "**To be clear,** this is far from the only argument for drug legalization! It is simply the argument we are well positioned to analyze today. "

    "\n",
    "When merging data, the result will only be meaningful if your understanding of how the data sets you are merging relate to one another are correct. In some ways, this is obvious — for example, if the variable(s) that you are using to merge observations in the two datasets or to actually identifying observations that should be linked, then obviously merging using those variables will create a meaningless new dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "But other properties that matter are often more subtle. For example, it's important to figure out whether your merge is a `1-to-1` merge (meaning there is only one observation of the variable you're merging on in both datasets), a `1-to-many` merge (meaning there is only one observation of the variable you're merging on in the first dataset, but multiple observations in the second), or a `many-to-many` merge (something you almost never do). \n",
    "\n",
    "Being correct in your assumptions about these things is *very* important. If you think there's only one observation per value of your merging variable in each dataset, but there are in fact 2, you'll end up with two observations for each value after the merge. Moreover, not only is the structure of your data now a mess, but the fact you were wrong means you didn't understand something about your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "So before running a merge, it is critical to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) What variable(s) do you think will be consistent across these two datasets you can use for merging? \n",
    "\n",
    "b) Do you think there will be exactly 1 observation for each value of this variable(s) in your arrest data?\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Do you think there will be exactly 1 observation for each value of this variable(s) in your population data?\n",
    "\n",
    "So in markdown, answer these three questions for this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then also specify the type of merge you were hoping to accomplish as one of the following strings — `\"one-to-one\"`, `\"one-to-many\"`, `\"many-to-one\"`, or `\"many-to-many\"` — in your `results` dictionary under the key `\"ex6_validate_keyword\"`. Assume that the first dataset we are talking about (e.g., the `one` in `one-to-many`, if that were your selection) is your arrests data and the second dataset (e.g., the `many` in `one-to-many`, if that were your selection)."

Validate will accept `\"1:1\"`, `\"1:m\"`, `\"m:1\"`, and `\"m:m\"`. It will then check to make sure your merge matches the type of merge you think it is. I *highly* recommend always using this option (...and not just because I'm the one who added `validate` to pandas).\n",

    "Make a scatter plot that shows the relationship between each county's violent arrest rate and it's drug arrest rate. Since we haven't done a lot with plotting yet, feel free to plot in whatever manner feels most comfortable. The easiest, if you're unsure, is just to use the `pandas` inbuilt `.plot()` method. Just specify the `x` keyword with your x-axis variable, the `y` keyword with your y-axis variable, and use `kind=\"scatter\"`."

    "The preceding analysis can tell us about whether violent crime and the drug trade are correlated, but it doesn't tell us much about whether they are *causally* related. It *could* be the case that people dealing drugs *cause* more violent crime, but it could also be that certain communities, for some other reason, tend to have *both* more drug sales *and* more violent crime. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help answer this question, let's examine whether violent crime arrest rates changed in response to drug legalization. In particular, let's do this by comparing violent crime arrest rates in 2009 (before drug legalization) to violent crime arrest rates in 2018 (after drug legalization). If the illegal drug trade causes violent crime, then we would expect the violent crime rate to fall in response to drug legalization.\n"

BUT: pre-post comparisons are imperfect. If we knew that violent crime was not going to change at all in a world without drug legalization, then this comparison is perfectly valid. But what if, absent drug legalization, violent crime would have fallen on its own (maybe because of advances in policing practices or a better economy)? Or maybe it would have increased?\n",

You have a patient with a headache, you give them tylenol, and then the next day you ask them if they still have a headache, and find out that they don't — does that mean that tylenol cured the headache? Maybe... but most headaches eventually resolve on their own, so maybe the headache would have passed with or without the patient taking tylenol! In fact, there's a term for this phenomenon in medicine — the \"natural history\" of a disease, which is the trajectory that we think a disease might follow absent treatment. And the natural history of the disease is almost never for it to stay exactly the same indefinitely.\n",

    "One way to try to overcome this problem is with something called a difference-in-difference analysis. Rather than just looking at whether violent drug arrest rates increase or decrease between 2009 and 2018, we can split our sample of counties into those that were *more* impacted by drug legalization and those that were *less* impacted by drug legalization and evaluate whether we see a greater change in the violent drug arrest rate in the counties that were more impacted. \n",
